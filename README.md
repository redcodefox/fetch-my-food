***What is Fetch My Food?***  
Fetch My Food is a personal project that has as main purpose to have people fill in the food they want to order that day.  
It is a web application that is built with mainly REACT as frontend and the PHP framework Symfony as backend.  
The project already runs for ~4 years at our company but with unmaintainable code, with this GitHub project I want to start from scratch and built version 3.
